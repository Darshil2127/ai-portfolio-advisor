# AI Portfolio Advisor Application: Project Summary and Deliverables

## 1. Project Overview

This project aimed to design and plan an AI-powered portfolio advisor application. The application allows users to upload their stock portfolio via a CSV file. Based on this portfolio, along with integrated stock market news, world news (economic indicators, geopolitical events like wars and tariffs), and stock price data, an AI engine provides recommendations to BUY, HOLD, or SELL specific stocks, including a suggested timeframe and justification for each recommendation.

## 2. Core Features Designed

*   **Portfolio Upload:** Users can upload a CSV file containing their stock holdings (Ticker, Quantity, optional PurchasePrice, optional PurchaseDate).
*   **Data Integration:** The system is designed to integrate data from:
    *   **YahooFinance API:** For stock charts (historical prices), stock insights (technicals, company info, news), and analyst opinions.
    *   **DataBank API:** For macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, etc.).
    *   Future considerations for broader world news APIs.
*   **AI Recommendation Engine:** A rule-based AI engine was designed as the initial approach for generating BUY/HOLD/SELL recommendations. The design includes:
    *   Detailed feature engineering from market data, technical indicators, fundamentals, news sentiment, and macroeconomic data.
    *   A mechanism for generating confidence scores, timeframes, and human-readable justifications for each recommendation.
*   **User Interface:** A web-based interface with two main pages:
    *   An **Upload Page** for submitting the portfolio CSV.
    *   A **Dashboard Page** to display the analysis and recommendations clearly.

## 3. Development Process and Design Documentation

The development process focused on a structured design phase, resulting in the following key documents that outline the application's architecture and functionality:

1.  **`application_requirements.md`**: Details the core functionalities, data sources, AI model inputs/outputs, UI/UX flow, and technology stack.
2.  **`portfolio_upload_design.md`**: Specifies the CSV file structure, backend logic for parsing and validation, and the database schema for storing portfolio data.
3.  **`data_integration_design.md`**: Outlines the strategy for using YahooFinance and DataBank APIs, module design for data fetching and aggregation, and data caching considerations.
4.  **`ai_recommendation_engine_design.md`**: Describes the feature engineering process, the chosen rule-based AI model architecture (with considerations for future ML models), data preprocessing steps, and the output format for recommendations.
5.  **`frontend_design.md`**: Details the UI/UX for the upload and dashboard pages, including navigation, styling considerations, and interaction with backend APIs.
6.  **`application_testing_plan.md`**: Provides a comprehensive plan for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure application quality and reliability.
7.  **`todo.md`**: A checklist tracking the progress through all design and planning phases.

## 4. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Flask (Python)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas, potentially SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
*   **APIs:** YahooFinance, DataBank (as per datasource module).

## 5. Current Status

All design and planning phases for the application are complete. The Flask project structure (`portfolio_advisor_app`) has been initialized. The next logical step, if proceeding to full development, would be the implementation of the backend logic, API clients, AI engine, and frontend components based on these design documents, followed by the execution of the testing plan.

This summary provides an overview of the work completed in designing the AI Portfolio Advisor application. The detailed design documents are provided as part of the deliverables.
